        <p class="sub-title-1">How it started</p>
        <p class="body-txt">Cookoo was an educational project. 
            Me and my teammate did not have many things in common. All we know was that we wanted to make an app that both of us were interested in, and we must have resources to take references from. As the result, we made a cooking app, so we seeked for problems that can be solved by this app, and people we could approach to test this app.
            </p>

        <p class="img-des">Cookoo process</p>
        <p class="body-txt">There are a lot of people who cook, but people that we can help might not be professional since we didn’t know anything about professional cooking. So we chose homecooks which mostly are married woman, due to our survey, who always lack of time for cooking. Another target were young inexperienced people like us. However, we only took the latter target as secondary. </p>
            <div class="space"></div>
        <p class="sub-title-1">Survey and interview</p>
        <p class="body-txt ab-ul">There were many factors needed to be firgured out in the first survey and interview:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="body-txt">Targets that scaled down to ages and backgrounds</p></li>
            <li><p class="body-txt">People’s cooking habit</p></li>
            <li><p class="body-txt">What problems they have while cooking</p></li>
            <li><p class="body-txt">And is there anything we could help with their diets (since people care about health so much these days)</p></li>
        </ul>

            <div class="space"></div>
        <p class="quotation">This question broke down our users into 2 big personas with different user journey: one plans first, and one buy ingredients first.</p>

        <p class="body-txt">There were 3 pieces of data that I considered to be crucial to Cookoo application: People potential interest in the app, how we’re gonna make this app profitable, and our competitors</p>
            <div class="space"></div>
        <p class="sub-title-2">Health becomes the #1 priority of people in Vietnam</p>
        <p class="body-txt">Eat-clean, phsical excersise movement, atmospheric patticular matter,... are some of the hottest keywords in the end of 2019, plus “covid-19” in the start of 2020. Only few of those matters highlighted how people care about their health.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>
        <p class="sub-title-2">E-commerce grew rapidly (but not direct in-app purchase)</p>
        <p class="body-txt">78% of internet users aged from 16 to 64, who report each activity in September 2019, purchased a product or service online. E-commerce spent for food and personal care in January 2019 was $348 million.
            Subsequently, adding e-commerce for fresh food category into the app is, by time, the trend and a relevant choice. 
            </p>
        <p class="body-txt">However, in-app purchase is not going to be popular soon in Vietnam (accept for gaming app), since it’s reported that Vietnamese doesn’t like to make pre-paid online purchase.</p>

        <p class="body-txt">There have already been a few popular cooking app in Vietnam already. However, only Cookpad seems to have neat task flows and simple UI, but its target users are different from ours. Yummly is a good reference to look after. I learned to use AI tech in the app from Yummly.</p>

        <p class="sub-title-1">App overview</p>
        <p class="body-txt">3 main parts of Cookoo app are Menu, Storage, and Explore. Other addition parts are Shopping list and Saved collection. </p>
        <p class="body-txt">At first, I was very excited in the idea of having weekly package ingredient as some kind of e-commerce in the app, yet, it was too ambitious to include such huge area (potentially becoming a complete e-comerce platform after my lecturer’s review) so I decided to put it away after a long time of consideration. </p>
            <div class="space"></div>
        <p class="sub-title-2">Taskflows are the most invested elements</p>
        <p class="body-txt">The shorter and efficient taskflows become, the better of user experience it is, so I focused on taskflows every time I need any design adjustment. Following taskflows would be sitemap and user interface. </p>
