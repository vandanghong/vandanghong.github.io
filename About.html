                <h1>Dang Hong Van</h1>
                <h2>Mayjored in Graphic Design, I’ve got many oppotunities taking part in events in my university and exploring my talent. 
                    <br>Throughout my years in FPTU, I have designed, supported, and direct communication graphics for 10 events in total. I’ve also done freelance jobs related to printing for 2 months, and had my internship as UI/UX designer in 5 months.
                    <br>I find myself comfortable working with long-term projects and tasks which required effort to learn, research, and think about. 
                    <br>Right now, I’m looking for a chance working with complex applications or systems. Email me if you think I’d fit in your firm.
